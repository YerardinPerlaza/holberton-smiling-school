# Holberton Smiling School
In this project, we will implement 3 web pages with Bootstrap. We will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design/Bootstrap knowledges that we learned previously.

We are free to implement it the way that we want - the objective is simple: Have fully functional web pages that look the same as the designer file.
